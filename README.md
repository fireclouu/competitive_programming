# My Competitive Programming Solutions
Collection of my solutions to multiple platform of competitive programming challenges

This includes, but not limited to:
- HackerRank
- LeetCode

Started doing these stuff sometime in June/July of 2024 by being engaged in technical programming challenge introduced by IBM using third-party platform, _HackerRank_.

## Acquisitions

- [x] Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in real-world scenarios
- [x] Standard sorting functions usage
- [x] Benchmarking modular functions
- [x] Extensive debugging tools
- [x] Constraints and tests suites exposures
- [x] Extreme considerations to "edge cases"
- [x] Number theory
- [x] Stacks, Maps, and Lists
- [x] Runtime memory usages / prioritization of memory allocation
- [x] Performance vs Resource Efficiency
- [x] Multiple ways tackling specific set of problems, programming-wise machine dependent
